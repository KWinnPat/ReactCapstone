          <h1>About My Capstone</h1>
          <p>
            This React capstone was a real struggle, and not just with the code.
            I was hit with a perfect storm of challenges: a major surgery and
            three week recovery that set me way behind, all while grappling with
            some intense depression and anxiety. The pressure to understand a
            mountain of missed material became overwhelming, leading to
            full-blown panic attacks. I’d stare at styled components, completely
            lost on why they wouldn't behave. I even ended up completely redoing
            them after I had finished them because I was just not happy with
            them. I even missed the initial deadline, but in a weird way, that
            failure was a blessing—it released the crushing expectations I’d put
            on myself and finally let me breathe and just focus on finishing.

            I won't lie, I do NOT like Javascript, or React. I understand it
            well enough, but it is frankly so conceptual in the sense that it's
            difficult to see what's happening behind the scenes. I personally
            prefer Python as a language, but that's because it's so... literal.
            It gives you the building blocks and tells you "Need something done?
            Figure it out." and bluntly? I love that. It doesn't try to provide
            a solution to everything. It just hands you the basic tools and it's
            on you to come up with a solution.
