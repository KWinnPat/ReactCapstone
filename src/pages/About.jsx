          This React capstone was a real battle, and not just with the code. I
          was hit with a perfect storm of challenges: a major surgery and
          recovery that set me way behind, all while grappling with some intense
          depression and anxiety. The pressure to understand a mountain of
          missed material became overwhelming, leading to full-blown panic
          attacks. I’d stare at styled components, completely lost on why they
          wouldn't behave. I even missed the initial deadline, but in a weird
          way, that failure was a gift—it released the crushing expectations I’d
          put on myself and finally let me breathe and just focus on finishing.
